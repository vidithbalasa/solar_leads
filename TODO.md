## Customer Questions
- How are they reaching out to cold leads? Door-to-door, phone, email, etc
- How much would they value ($) a lead that is more likely to convert?
	- Does it make more sense to give a lot of cold leads, or a small number of warm leads
- What are the key features of a property that they care about / look for?
	- What features of a property / customer are most likely to lead to a sale?
- How do they currently track their leads?
	- Do they have a CRM, would they need CRM integration?
- Where do they get their leads from currently
